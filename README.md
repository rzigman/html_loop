This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to use the app

Once you do 'npm start' go to the web page and you simple click the button and in the console in developer tools in the browser you will see it print out the number of the loop it is on and the milliseconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second and each loop waits 500 before continuing to the next increment in the loop. You will also be alerted on the page when you click the button.
